","Brown had been working for the modern-day Tony Stark Elon Musk for the last 12 years. She worked really hard as she would travel back and forth between Los Angeles and Silicon Valley every week, work late at night, and even on the weekends.","She used to handle Musk\u2019s scheduling across two companies (SpaceX and Tesla), manage public relations, and often help Musk make business decisions.","Ashlee Vance, who told this story in his book \u201cElon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,\u201d described Brown like this","Brown \u2014 or MB, as everyone called her \u2014 became Musk\u2019s loyal assistant, establishing a real-life version of the relationship between Iron Man\u2019s Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. If Musk worked a twenty-hour day, so too did Brown. Over the years, she brought Musk meals, set up his business appointments, arranged time with his children, picked out his clothes, dealt with press requests, and when necessary yanked Musk out of meetings to keep him on schedule. As a result, she would emerge as the only bridge between Musk and all of his interests and was an invaluable asset to the companies\u2019 employees.","Ashlee also mentioned that Brown had an outstanding contribution in developing SpaceX\u2019s early culture as she paid close attention to every detail and helped balance the vibe around the office. ","Anyway, Brown went to Musk and asked for a raise. To be specific, she wanted to be compensated as per SpaceX\u2019s top executives. Do you know what Elon Musk told her in response? He told Brown to take a couple of weeks off so that he would realize how hard Brown\u2019s responsibilities were. Actually, Musk wanted to realize how indispensable Brown was for him.","So, Brown took a 2-week off and Musk took over her job.","After the two weeks when Brown came to the office, Musk told her that he didn\u2019t need her service anymore. It was a real shock to Brown. I mean no one gets fired for asking for a raise, right? ","In the book, Ashlee wrote that this unceremonious event struck people inside SpaceX and Tesla, and it confirmed the lore around Musk\u2019s cruel stoicism and lack of empathy.","Musk claimed that he offered Brown another job with the same pay, but she refused and left the company.
